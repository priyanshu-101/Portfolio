            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As a web developer, I have experience creating and maintaining websites and web applications. My skill
                set includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks such as React.

                I have experience working with databases like MySQL.

                I am a problem solver and enjoy the process of taking a project from concept to completion. I am able to
                work independently or as part of a team, and am always looking to learn and improve my skills.

                I am committed to creating websites and web applications that are not only functional, but also meet the
                specific needs and goals of my clients.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>As a fresher web developer, I would have likely gained experience through coursework and internships. I
                would be familiar with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I would have experience
                building and designing websites, and be familiar
                with web development frameworks and libraries. Additionally, I would have a basic understanding of web
                development concepts such as responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and web performance
                optimization. As a fresher, I would be eager to learn and continue to develop my skills in the field.
